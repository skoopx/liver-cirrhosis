# liver-cirrhosis
A disease called cirrhosis is characterised by the replacement of scar tissue with healthy liver tissue, which lowers liver function. 
It is frequently linked to autoimmune illnesses, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, excessive alcohol intake, and chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B or C. 
As cirrhosis worsens, it causes liver failure and a host of other problems, such as ascites, portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and a higher chance of developing liver cancer. 
The liver is vital to the body because it filters blood and carries out other vital tasks. 
Acute liver failure patients are more susceptible to infections, especially those that affect the circulatory, respiratory, and urinary systems. 
A common aftereffect of liver failure is kidney failure, particularly when paracetamol overdose occurs, as this medication can harm the kidneys as well as the liver. 
The application of machine learning to healthcare has made it possible to use historical datasets to predict liver cirrhosis early on. 
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model based on AI that can forecast liver cirrhosis based on a provided dataset. 
Using hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy, the project uses machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and the Gradient Boosted Classifier using XGBoost. 
By using GridSearch in XGBoost, the project ultimately achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 98%, along with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 96%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. 
The results of this research could contribute to the emergence of more sophisticated and precise liver cirrhosis prediction models, which would be beneficial for researchers working in the field.
